# Python Connect four(terminal version)

 This is an simple python Connect four  game 


USAGE:


       I created this game based of the simple classic Connect four  game which can play on the terminal
       most of the logic involved in this are relatively simple and anyone can clearly understands it.
       This game will only work on terminal and have no user-interface.After building this game 
       i decided to make the same game with bit more robust and after that also a gui version as well


WHAT I LEARNED:


       1. By developing this game on numpy, i think i got some new logics
       
       2. This game was too esay, so i don't get anything special out of it.
